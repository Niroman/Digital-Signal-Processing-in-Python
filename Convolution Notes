Definition of Cross-Correlation
1.Cross Correlation is the measure of similarity of two series as a function of displacement of one relative to other.
2.It is used to search a long signal for a shorter known feature.
3.Similar to convolution
4.Used for finding a known signal.

Properties
1.Linearity
2. Difference and Running SUM
First Difference -> Each sample in the output signal is equal to the difference between the adjacent samples
y[n] = x[n] - x[n-1]
Running Sum -> Recursive and difference equation.
y[n] = x[n]+y[n+1]
3. Commuatitive a[n]*b[n] = b[n]*a[n]
4. Distributive and associative
