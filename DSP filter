Basic Analog filters.
1. Bessel Filters
2. Butterworth Filters - good frequency response
3. Chebyshev filters - bedt frequency response

Building filters of Analog Filters

1. RC Passive Low pass filter.
    High Freq -> It becomes a short circuit
    Low Freq -> It becomes open circuit.

Cutoff Frequency is used to design the Analog Filters: Fc = 1/2(pi)R*C

Modified Sallen Key Filter:
1. Made of active and passive companents.

Synthesis - > The only way to combine two signals is by scaling and addition
Decomposition -> Removing the additive components
Impulse Decomposition
1. Only the samples value is set to one. other values are set to zero

Step Decomposition
1. The sampled value is set to one and the rest of the signal is also set to zero in the same plane.

Convolution:
1.Delta Function is a normalized Impulse Response.(Unit Impulse)
2.Impulse Response: If the Delta function passess a system it will produce an Impulse Response.


Sampling Rate and Nyquist rate
x = sin(2000*pi*t)
f = 1000
Nyq Rate = 2*1000
1. Nyquist Rate - Two times the maximum Frequency in Hz.
2. Nyquist Interval - 1/Nyq Rate - in Sec

Nyquist Sampling Theorem Says this:

Sampling Rate (Nyquist Rate) should be double the maximum frequency.
Nyquist Frequency ( Sampling Frequency)


In signal processing, the Nyquist rate, named after Harry Nyquist, is twice the bandwidth of a bandlimited function or a bandlimited channel. ...
as a lower bound for the sample rate for alias-free signal sampling
(not to be confused with the Nyquist frequency, which is half the sampling rate of a discrete-time system) and
