1. Fourier Analysis is mainly used for Discrete Fourier Transform

Periodic - Discrete Signals can be analysed by "Discrete Fourier Transform"
Periodic - Continous Signals can be analysed by "Fourier Series"
APeriodic - Discrete Signals can be analysed by "Discrete Time Fourier Transform"
APeriodic - Continous Signals can be analysed by "Fourier Transform"

2. Discrete Fourier Transform.
A 16 point signal can be converted into Sine or cos wave using DFT.

N-Point signal(Time Domain) -> DFT (Fourier Transform)->(1. N/2+1Cosine waves , 2. N/2+Sine wave) ->(Frequency domain has the Real part and the Complex Part)

Time Domain x[] -> (Analysis, Decomposition,Forward DFT or DFT) -> Frequency Domain
Time Domain <- (Synthesis,Inverse DFT) <- Frequency Domain X[]

3. Three ways of representing the signal in Frequency Domain.
1. In Points(N/2 -> Real & N/2 -> Imaginary) They are called end points
2. As a sampling frequency (Nyquist theorem)
3. As a phase signal.(0 to pie) Natural Frequency.

Amplitude -> X-axis
Frequency -> Y-axis

Analysis: DFT (Sending the signal)
Synthesis:IDFT (Any signal can be reproduced by adding the sine and cosine wave by N/2)
Zero Crossings: When the signal crosses the zero line. It will cause a phase shit and distortion.
